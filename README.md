# üí° Interactive Consumer Surplus App

This interactive app illustrates a core concept in microeconomics:  
**Consumer Surplus depends not just on price and quantity, but on the shape of the demand curve.**

Built with [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) and [Plotly](https://plotly.com/python/), the app lets you explore how changes in the **slope (elasticity)** of a linear demand curve affect the welfare that consumers derive from a given market price.

## üìà What the App Shows

The plot displays:
- A **linear demand curve** that always pivots through the same equilibrium point (Price = 50, Quantity = 10)
- The **original price** (dashed line at P = 50)
- A **new lower price** (dotted purple line at P = 40)
- **Consumer Surplus (CS)** at the original price, shaded in green
- **Additional CS** from the price drop, shaded in purple

Use the **slider** to change the **slope of the demand curve** (i.e., its elasticity), and watch:

- How the **area of surplus changes**, even though the price and quantity at equilibrium remain the same
- How **elastic vs. inelastic demand** affects the welfare gain from a price change
